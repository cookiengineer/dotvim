===========================================================================
Intro ~

Every once in a while one pastes some (markup) code or prose from the internet
into Vim and is at loss why it does not compile or render as meant to. This
plug-in offers a hint and a solution by providing

- highlighting of Unicode Homoglyphs, characters (among them many white
  spaces) that only appear like ASCII characters but are not, and
- the normal mode mapping cu to toggle it,

and

- an operator mapping gy in normal mode, for example gyip operates on a
  paragraph,
- a mapping gyy (and gygy) in normal mode that operates on a single line,
- a mapping gy that operates on the visual selection, and
- a command NormalizeHomoglyphs that operates on given range (equal to the
  whole buffer if unspecified)

that normalize Unicode Homoglyphs.

Usage ~

For example, hitting gyip on

!ǃ！
"״″＂

turns it into

!!!
""""

Configuration ~

To disable highlighting of Unicode Homoglyphs by default, add to your vimrc the
line

>
    let g:is_homoglyph_on = 0
<

To change mappings, for example, to use zy instead of gy and zu instead of cu,
add the lines

>
    nmap zy <plug>(NormalizeHomoglyphs)
    xmap zy <plug>(NormalizeHomoglyphs)

    nmap zu <plug>(HighlightHomoglyphs)
<

to your vimrc.

For more convenient version control of prose, see the Vim plug-in
vim-sentence-chopper that puts each sentence onto a single line.
